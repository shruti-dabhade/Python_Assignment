""": Design a Python application that creates two threads named EvenFactor and 
OddFactor.
• Both threads should accept one integer number as a parameter.
• The EvenFactor thread should:
◦ Identify all even factors of the given number.
◦ Calculate and display the sum of even factors.
• The OddFactor thread should:
◦ Identify all odd factors of the given number.
◦ Calculate and display the sum of odd factors.
• After both threads complete execution, the main thread should display the message: 
“Exit from main"""
